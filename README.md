# Zombify
A game where a survivor must outlive a zombie attack with the power of guns and slow motion. Significant progress has been made with the game but still a few days worth of work left.  Basic movement (side to side, jumping) and mechanics (slow-motion) are complete for the most part. Enemies (zombies) and hit detection have been added. Dynamic gameplay and scoring are the next landmarks.
